# Agent Skills

Skills are contextual prompts that teach AI coding assistants how to accomplish specific clinical research tasks. They activate automatically when relevant — ask about "SOFA scores" or "sepsis cohorts" and the AI uses validated SQL from MIT-LCP repositories. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## What Skills Do

Without skills, an AI assistant might guess at APIs or make assumptions about clinical concepts. With M4 skills installed:

- **m4-api**: Claude knows to call `set_dataset()` before queries, returns proper DataFrames, handles errors correctly
- **Clinical skills**: Claude understands SOFA scoring, Sepsis-3 criteria, KDIGO AKI staging, and other validated clinical concepts

## Installing Skills

During initial setup:

```bash
m4 config claude --skills
```

Or install to an existing project:

```bash
# Interactive tool and skill selection
m4 skills

# Install all skills for specific tools
m4 skills --tools claude,cursor

# Install only validated clinical skills
m4 skills --tools claude --tier validated --category clinical

# Install specific skills by name
m4 skills --tools claude --skills sofa-score,sepsis-3-cohort,m4-api

# List installed skills (with tier and category)
m4 skills --list
```

Filters combine with AND logic: `--tier validated --category clinical` installs only skills that are both validated and clinical. Filtered installs are additive — existing skills that don't match the filter are left untouched.

Skills are installed to `.claude/skills/` (or equivalent for other tools). AI assistants automatically discover skills in these locations.

## Skills vs. Derived Tables

Skills and derived tables are complementary. Both use the same clinical knowledge source (mimic-code), but serve different purposes:

**Derived tables** (`mimiciv_derived.*`) provide pre-computed results. After running `m4 init-derived mimic-iv`, tables like `mimiciv_derived.sofa` are ready to query directly. For standard analyses, derived tables are preferred — they are faster, validated, and consistent.

**Skills** provide adaptable SQL patterns that the AI can modify for non-standard use cases. When you need a custom SOFA variant, different time windows, or novel concept combinations, skills give the AI the clinical knowledge to generate correct queries from scratch.

**When to use which:**
- Use derived tables for standard clinical concepts — they are pre-computed and immediately available
- Use skills when you need customized logic or when working with datasets without derived tables (e.g., eICU)
- Skills and derived tables can be used together — e.g., joining a custom cohort with `mimiciv_derived.sofa`

## Skill Structure

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file:

```
.claude/skills/
├── m4-api/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── sofa-score/
│   └── SKILL.md
│   └── scripts/
│       └── sofa.sql
├── sepsis-3-cohort/
│   └── SKILL.md
│   └── scripts/
│       └── sepsis3.sql
```

The frontmatter has four required fields: `name`, `description`, `tier` (one of `validated`, `expert`, `community`), and `category` (`clinical` or `system`).

## Creating Custom Skills

You can extend M4 with project-specific skills:

```markdown
---
name: cardiac-surgery-cohort
description: Identify cardiac surgery patients. Triggers on "CABG", "valve replacement"
tier: community
category: clinical
---

# Cardiac Surgery Cohort Selection

When identifying cardiac surgery patients in MIMIC-IV:

1. Use procedure codes from `procedures_icd` table
2. Filter by ICD-10-PCS codes starting with '02' (heart and great vessels)
3. Consider combining with `d_icd_procedures` for code descriptions
```

Place in `.claude/skills/cardiac-surgery-cohort/SKILL.md` and Claude will use it when discussing cardiac surgery research.

## Tips for Effective Skills

- **Be specific about triggers.** The description should clearly indicate when the skill applies.
- **Include working code examples.** Claude learns patterns from examples. Show exact imports, function calls, and expected outputs.
- **Document edge cases.** What errors might occur? What datasets are required?
- **Keep skills focused.** One skill per domain or workflow.
- **Reference validated sources.** Clinical skills should cite their sources.

## Clinical Skill Sources

All clinical research skills are extracted from MIT-LCP validated repositories:

- **mimic-code**: [github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code)
- **eicu-code**: [github.com/MIT-LCP/eicu-code](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/eicu-code)

These repositories contain peer-reviewed implementations used in hundreds of published studies.
