# Getting Started

This guide walks you through installing M4 and running your first clinical data query. No prior experience with terminals, Python, or databases is needed. {{ className: 'lead' }}

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A computer running macOS, Windows, or Linux
- An internet connection
- About 20 minutes
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) (or another AI client that supports MCP)

## Step 1: Open a terminal

A terminal (also called a command line) is a text-based way to interact with your computer. You type commands and press Enter to run them.

**macOS:** Press `Cmd+Space` to open Spotlight Search, type **Terminal** and press Enter.

**Windows:** Press `Win+X` and select **Terminal** (or **PowerShell**).

**Linux:** Press `Ctrl+Alt+T` (on most distributions), or search for **Terminal** in your applications menu.

<Note>
  **How to paste into a terminal:** On macOS: `Cmd+V`. On Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+V` (note the Shift).
</Note>

## Step 2: Install uv

`uv` is a tool that manages Python and Python packages. Run one of these commands in your terminal:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

This downloads and installs `uv`, a fast Python package manager. It also installs Python if you didn't already have it. You only need to do this once.

After the install completes, **close and reopen your terminal** so the `uv` command is available.

## Step 3: Create a project and install M4

Run these commands one at a time:

```bash
mkdir my-research
cd my-research
uv init
uv add m4-infra
```

## Step 4: Activate the virtual environment

A virtual environment keeps M4's dependencies separate from the rest of your system. You need to activate it each time you open a new terminal session:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

<Note>
  If you close your terminal and come back later, you'll need to `cd my-research` and activate the environment again before using M4 commands.
</Note>

## Step 5: Initialize the demo dataset

```bash
m4 init mimic-iv-demo
```

This downloads the free MIMIC-IV demo dataset (~16 MB) containing 100 de-identified patient records and creates a local database. No credentials or applications are required.

[MIMIC-IV](https://mimic.mit.edu/) (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) is a large, freely-available database of de-identified health records from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The demo version contains a small subset (100 patients) that anyone can access for free. The full version (365,000+ patients) requires credentialed access through PhysioNet.

## Step 6: Connect your AI client

**Claude Desktop:**
```bash
m4 config claude --quick
```
This automatically updates Claude Desktop's configuration. Restart Claude Desktop to apply.

**Other clients (Cursor, LibreChat, etc.):**
```bash
m4 config --quick
```
This prints a JSON configuration block. Copy it into your client's MCP server settings, then restart the client.

## Step 7: Ask your first question

Open Claude Desktop (or your configured AI client) and try:

> *"What tables are available in the database?"*

You should see a list of clinical data tables. Then try:

> *"Show me the gender distribution in hospital admissions"*

You're now using AI-assisted clinical data analysis.

## Quick version

Already comfortable with the command line? Here's the whole setup in 6 lines:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh  # Install uv (skip if you have it)
mkdir my-research && cd my-research
uv init && uv add m4-infra
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
m4 init mimic-iv-demo
m4 config claude --quick   # Or: m4 config --quick
```
