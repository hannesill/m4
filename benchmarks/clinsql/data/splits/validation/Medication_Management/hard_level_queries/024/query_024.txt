I’m evaluating a 73‑year‑old woman with multi‑trauma. For female inpatients 68–78 with multi‑trauma, report first‑24h medication complexity quartiles, average complexity percentile, LOS and mortality for those with serotonergic interaction risk versus other multi‑trauma patients, and LOS/mortality for top quartile.
