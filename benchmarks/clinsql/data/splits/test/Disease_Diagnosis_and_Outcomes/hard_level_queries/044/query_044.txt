I’m evaluating a 64‑year‑old woman. Among female inpatients aged 59–69 with cardiac arrest, stratified into quartiles by composite risk score, report for each quartile: 30‑day mortality, cardiovascular and neurologic complication rates, median survivor LOS, and baseline 30‑day mortality for all female 59–69.
