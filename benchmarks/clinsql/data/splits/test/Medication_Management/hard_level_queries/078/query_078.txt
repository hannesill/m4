I’m evaluating a 79‑year‑old woman with PE. Among female inpatients aged 74–84, within the first 24 hours report medication complexity distribution (mean, min, max, SD), prevalence of QT‑prolonging and bleeding‑risk drugs, mean complexity percentiles, ICU comparison, and top‑quartile LOS and mortality.
