I’m evaluating a 62-year-old male post–solid-organ transplant in the ICU. Among male ICU patients aged 57–67, compare Transplant vs Non‑Transplant during the first 72 hours: median and percentiles of composite instability score (count of fever>38.5°C, SpO2<90%, RR>20 events), ICU LOS, and mortality.
