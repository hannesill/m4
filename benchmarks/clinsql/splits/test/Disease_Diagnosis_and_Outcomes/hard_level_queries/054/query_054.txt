I have a 64‑year‑old female inpatient. Among female inpatients 59–69 with PE and high comorbidity burden, state mean comorbidity risk score and 30‑day mortality; compare cardio/neurologic complication rates and survivor LOS to same‑age general inpatients, and state matched profile percentile vs controls.
