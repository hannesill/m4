I’m evaluating an 87-year-old woman admitted with pneumonia. Among female inpatients aged 82–92 with pneumonia, stratified into quintiles by the study’s composite risk score, report for each quintile: 30‑day mortality, cardiovascular and neurologic complication rates, and median LOS among survivors.
